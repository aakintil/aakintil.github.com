 As part of my Human-Computer Interaction Capstone Project, I am acting as Technical Lead on a team of 5 interdisciplinary students. We are working with NASA and improving astronaut and engineer procedure execution efficiency. NASA's astronauts and engineers are constantly executing detailed tasks, which are currently in the form of paper documents called procedures. These procedures often require the use of specific tools or materials that are difficult to locate and identify. A significant amount of time and effort is wasted trying to find these materials and verify that they are calibrated or in maintained properly for immediate use. During the 8 months that we're working with NASA, we plan on providing a solution to this problem by the beginning of August  \

          Back in January, we had our kickoff meeting with our client Matthew Sharpe. This meeting served as a formal introduction to the team and NASA's problem at hand. In the meeting, we learnt that not only are procedures paper based, but there are specific steps that occur in succession. These procedures have to be signed by the engineer and a present QA engineer. Afterwards, since we are unable to fly up to the ISS and observe astronauts (Lisa was sad about that), we discussed analogous domains that we could perform contextual inquiries on. After naming a few, we decided to plot out the characteristics that each domain had in common with astronauts and engineers at NASA. Matt then mapped out ideas about how our solution could affect NASA employees and showed us a new way to affinity. The takeaway from Matt’s diagram was smart procedures: based on the context, our solution could possibly tell an astronaut where his tools are located, which tools are necessary or can be replaced if malfunctioning, and redirect an astronaut if he skips a step or if there’s a more efficient way to do said step. Matt then taught us how to do an affinity brainstorm with questions! This was exceptionally useful because it gave us a better look at the characteristics in each domain we should focus on, and it gave us useful (general and specific) questions to use in our contextual inquiries. \

                I looked through food, travel, and lifestyle magazines to draw inspiration for the design language of the magazine. On the top half of my board, there are pantone and earthy colors that are warm and calming yet exciting. On the bottom half of my board, there are much brighter colors that you would find in foods, and at times table decor. \

                Deciding on the typeface was the next difficult issue for me. I went through about 20 variations, most of which looked terrible to be honest, before I finally settled on LT Osaka and Yanone Kaffeesatz for my headers, and Roboto slab for my text. Finally, selecting my magazine's logo was a necessary yet painful process. I was never happy with my decision. I wanted a FAT logo that was skinny, but sometimes I wanted a FAT logo that was actually fat! I could not make up my mind. Eventually it came down to a matter of time and luck. The project was due in less than 10 hours and I still was very unhappy with cover. Oddly enough, I had chose LT Osaka for parts of my headers already, but it never dawned on me to try it on the front page. I think it worked out really well!

            <li> I worked for <a class='project-links' target='_blank' href='http://clickbrands.com/'>ClickBrands</a> as a Front-End Designer. It was my first real front-end gig and I bloody loved it! Initially, I got my feet wet with a project called <a class='project-links' target='_blank' href='http://www.apartmentlinks.com/'>Apartment Links</a>, but the bulk of our time and effort was spent revamping their old apartment ratings site to Apartment Reviews (.net). The best part was that because we had a small team, I not only did front-end tasks, but I designed mockups, helped with the user experience of the site, helped with their Ruby on Rails framework, and migrated the working front-end prototypes into the application. </li> \

            <li> For the final project in our Interaction Design Fundamentals course, we needed to investigate e-magazines in a certain domain and find an opportunity where we can introduce something new to the space. The space I decided to explore was travel with a dash of food. My design was targeted towards mid twenty to early thirty year olds that love to travel and eat. While designing the feel and layout of the magazine we were tasked with keeping specific interactions in mind, or creating our own. </li> \

                Finding the right magazine type was difficult. I envisioned myself doing a magazine on sushi and japan, but after discussions with my peers and professor, I found that food was not one of the acceptable categories. And doing a piece on just japan seemed too boring to me. So rather than waste time thinking about the type of magazine, I began designing my mood board, thinking more about the feelings I wanted my magazine to elicit from my audience. Afterwards, I decided on making a Japanese Travel magazine that highlighted the popular foods in this issue's cities. I was then able to create my personas: the gastronomer Angela Nhu, the recent grad Amelie Duval, and the software engineer Jonathan Mbu. Each of these personas loved food as much as they loved to travel, which made them perfect for my magazine! \

                I looked through food, travel, and lifestyle magazines to draw inspiration for the design language of the magazine. On the top half of my board, there are pantone and earthy colors that are warm and calming yet exciting. On the bottom half of my board, there are much brighter colors that you would find in foods, and at times table decor. \

                Deciding on the typeface was the next difficult issue for me. I went through about 20 variations, most of which looked terrible to be honest, before I finally settled on LT Osaka and Yanone Kaffeesatz for my headers, and Roboto slab for my text. Finally, selecting my magazine's logo was a necessary yet painful process. I was never happy with my decision. I wanted a FAT logo that was skinny, but sometimes I wanted a FAT logo that was actually fat! I could not make up my mind. Eventually it came down to a matter of time and luck. The project was due in less than 10 hours and I still was very unhappy with cover. Oddly enough, I had chose LT Osaka for parts of my headers already, but it never dawned on me to try it on the front page. I think it worked out really well!

If you're also interested in seeing the entire book (please keep in mind it's not really interactive), a download of that is also available below!     \

                For the final layout, I created the cover, two table of contents - one for food and one for travel, an example of a an interactive title page that lets the reader explore Japan, and finally, a two-page feature on a perfect Japanese dish: Kaiseki.   \

  <p id=''> This was a course project where we were tasked with choosing an organism, researching various aspects about the organism, and then coming up with a way to apply features of said organism to architecture. Through lots of iterations, ideation, and failure, my team and I designed a responsive building technology based on our initial organism: a pufferfish. We began by reading numerous research documents about pufferfish and learning about the organism's anatomy. At the end of the semester our professor connected us with Nina Barbuto, who is the founder and director of Assemble, an interdisciplinary arts and creativity space in Pittsburgh’s East End. She graciously allowed students from my class and another taught by the same professor to exhibit the prototypes we had been working on during the semester. <br> <br> This was a difficult project for two reasons: it forced my team and myself out of our comfort zones, and our prototypes and designs failed...a lot. But failure is never bad unless you're unable to understand what you did wrong and learn from it. This course taught me to research, design, and build with no constraints. Most, if not all, of my previous projects have had some form of tangible end goal. This was my first time experiencing an truly open ended project: the only end goal was to have something by the end of the semester. I did not like it at the time, but I eventually realized that that is how industry is: a client is going to ask you to build or design 'something' for them, and it's up to you to find a scope and gradually narrow it as you proceed further. \

  <p id=''> Another project from my IDM II course. This was our main introduction to laser cutting and parametric modeling. The basic premise of this project was to design a canopy that fulfilled the dimension requirements for the class. Other than that, the model had to be able to assembled when printed. I chose a very simple canopy design: one without waves and drastic increase or decrease in its width. I was not as skilled with Rhino and Grasshopper as the other students, but that is one of the reasons I liked my design. We also had to create an assembly diagram: if someone were to have the waffle canopy pieces, they would be able to assemble it without our help.  \

  <p id=''> This was an exceptional and though provoking course. Every project was team based and recorded onto a team website. Classes were split into lecture / discussions and then work sessions. The lectures were about 'underlying robotic technologies, as they relate to human-robot interaction, interaction methodologies and techniques, study design, ethics and the singularity, and man-machine coupling. Some classes were discussions of application domains that feature HRI. An example of a project we did was researching and designing interactions for automated cars. We had to take into consideration the variables that can occur at an intersection: children, people not paying attention to incoming traffic, visually impaired, etc. Then we brainstormed numerous ways a self-driving vehicle can communicate with pedestrians, and vice versa. In the end we broke our ideas up into three sense categories: audition, sight, and touch. Through our discussions and iterations, we designed an interactive eye around the bottom half of the self-driving vehicle, as well as a vibrating device that would be attached to a stop sign or object near the intersection.  \

  <p id=''> UCRE is an acronym for user centered research & evaluation. It is a required course for Carnegie Mellon's Master of Human Computer Interaction program. UCRE taught us methods and tools to understand, improve, and create technology that harmonizes with and improves human capabilities, goals, and social environments. We learnt methods such as 'think aloud protocols, interviews, log analyses, competitive analyses, contextual design, and much more. We had a couple individual assignments but most were group based where we learnt and practiced research methods. Below are some pictures of the contextual design process my team and I learnt and applied to solving problems in the Computer Science department. You can download some of the documents I worked on (with and without teams) below. If you want more documents, names of team members, or more information about what we did in this course, don't hesitate to shoot me an email!   \

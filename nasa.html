     <p>
       As part of my Human-Computer Interaction Capstone Project I am acting as Tech Lead on a team of 5 interdisciplinary students. We are working with NASA and improving astronaut and engineer procedure execution efficiency. NASA\'s astronauts and engineers are constantly executing detail tasks, which are currently represented as static documents called procedures. These procedures often require the use of specific tools or materials that are difficult to locate and identify. A significant amount of time and resources spent finding and verifying these tools and materials. By improving procedure execution processes NASA personnel to use their time and resources more efficiently.

       We are trying to understand the context in which astronauts and engineers use tools during procedure execution, and to design a solution that increases their efficiency in order to maximize their time spent on scientific exploration.

       We are currently in the research phase of this project. We have performed a literature review examining relevant theories such as spatial cognition and interruptibility. We have also completed a competitive review, which examines other domains that have similar problems and their solutions. Since we are unable to directly observe astronauts in the ISS and have limited access to NASA engineers, we have identified analogous domains to perform contextual inquiry on. These analogous domains include laboratory scientists, machinists, and test lab engineers. The insights we will uncover through these contextual inquiries will map to the NASA context, and allow us to create a meaningful design solution

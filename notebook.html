                This was a course project where we were tasked with choosing an organism, researching various aspects about the organism, and then coming up with a way to apply features of said organism to architecture. Through lots of iterations, ideation, and failure, my team and I designed a responsive building technology based on our initial organism: a pufferfish. We began by reading numerous research documents about pufferfish and learning about the organism's anatomy. This was a difficult project for two reasons: it forced my team and myself out of our comfort zones, and our prototypes and designs failed...a lot. But failure is never bad unless you're unable to understand what you did wrong and learn from it. This course taught me to research, design, and build without constraints. Most, if not all, of my previous projects have had some form of tangible end goal. This was my first time experiencing an truly open ended project. I did not like it at the time, but I eventually realized that industry might be similar to this. A client is going to ask you to build or design 'something' for them, and it's up to you to figure out what they need built, scope it out, and deliver the end product to them.

                This was a course project where we were tasked with designing a hexagonal wall pattern not unlike matsys's wall. We started off designing one tile, however, the end goal was to create a design that when rotated and placed together with other tiles, would create a new form or pattern along a wall. It was my first time really diving into Rhino and I struggled with the software. But now, I'm glad to say that I have working knowledge of Rhino!

              <h4> Waffle Canopy </h4>                                 
              <p>Another project from my IDM II course. This was our main introduction to laser cutting and parametric modeling. The basic premise of this project was to design a canopy that fulfilled the dimension requirements for the class. Other than that, the model had to be able to assembled when printed. I chose a very simple canopy design: one without waves and drastic increase or decrease in its width. I was not as skilled with Rhino and Grasshopper as the other students, but that is one of the reasons I liked my design. We also had to create an assembly diagram: if someone were to have the waffle canopy pieces, they would be able to assemble it without our help.

              <h4> Human Robot Interaction </h4>                                 
              <p> This was an exceptional and though provoking course. Every project was team based and recorded onto a team website. Classes were split into lecture / discussions and then work sessions. The lectures were about 'underlying robotic technologies, as they relate to human-robot interaction, interaction methodologies and techniques, study design, ethics and the singularity, and man-machine coupling. Some classes were discussions of application domains that feature HRI. An example of a project we did was researching and designing interactions for automated cars. We had to take into consideration the variables that can occur at an intersection: children, people not paying attention to incoming traffic, visually impaired, etc. Then we brainstormed numerous ways a self-driving vehicle can communicate with pedestrians, and vice versa. In the end we broke our ideas up into three sense categories: audition, sight, and touch. Through our discussions and iterations, we designed an interactive eye around the bottom half of the self-driving vehicle, as well as a vibrating device that would be attached to a stop sign or object near the intersection.

Hey!
  So this is basically just my portfolio site. The interesting
  i did was customized page transitions. I spent more time on the
  design and little interactions though. I have wireframes and logo
  sketches and if you want them just let me know and i'll email them. 
  You should be able to run this on any browser, however i did not
  have time to test, so to be safe i would use firefox. 
  
  For this i used the following libraries for reference: 
  PageTransitions.js https://github.com/codrops/PageTransitions
  
  I used code from these:
  ElementTransitions.js http://dan-silver.github.io/ElementTransitions.js/
  BoxLayout.js http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/23/fullscreen-layout-with-page-transitions/

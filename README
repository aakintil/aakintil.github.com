Hey!
  So this is basically just my portfolio site. The interesthing
  i did was customized page transitions. I spent more time on the
  design and little interactions though. I have wireframes and logo
  sketches and if you want them just let me know and i'll email them. 
  You should be able to run this on any browser, however i did not
  have time to test, but i coded with firefox
  For this i used the following libraries for reference: 
  
  PageTransitions.js https://github.com/codrops/PageTransitions
  
  I used code from this:
  ElementTransitions.js http://dan-silver.github.io/ElementTransitions.js/
